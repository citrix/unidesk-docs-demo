#Export log files for Support
You can export logs for your Unidesk Enterprise Layer Manager (ELM), and send them to the Unidesk Support team via HTTPS or to yourself and others  by email. 
This topic explains what log files are available for export, and which log files are useful for what kinds of issues. It then explains how to export each of the logs. 
About exporting Unidesk logs
Unidesk log files are text files that contain useful information for the Unidesk Support Team when helping you to resolve an issue. The exported logs are stripped of any passwords and encryption keys, so none of your credentials can be compromised. 
###What log files are exported?
Each export includes the logs for the Unidesk ELM.The Database Crash Dump file export is optional. When you export logs, the Unidesk software creates a gzipped tar file  (.tgz) containing the log files. A task with the URL for each tar file appears in the Task bar.
