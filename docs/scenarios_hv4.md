#Test drive: Publish to Microsoft RDS in Hyper-V
Once Unidesk is set up, you can use this test drive to create your first layers in Hyper-V, and then publish a test image to MSRDS. With this first experience will come an understanding of the layering work flow, and relatively easy image maintenance. 
Please download the Test Drive from this Unidesk [forum article](http://www.unidesk.com/forum/unidesk-4/process-documentation-publish-rds-and-hyper-v)[.](http://www.unidesk.com/forum/unidesk-4/process-documentation-publish-rds-and-hyper-v)
If you have any questions, please ask your Unidesk Solutions Architect for assistance.
