#Test drive: Publish to PVS for XenApp 6.5 users
Once Unidesk is set up, you can use this test drive to create your first layers in vSphere, and then publish a test image to Horizon View. With this first experience will come an understanding of the layering work flow, and relatively easy image maintenance. 
Please download the Test Drive from this Unidesk [forum article](http://www.unidesk.com/forum/unidesk-4/process-documentation-publish-pvs-7-vsphere-xenapp-65-broker)[.](http://www.unidesk.com/forum/unidesk-4/process-documentation-publish-pvs-7-vsphere-xenapp-65-broker)
If you have any questions, please ask your Unidesk Solutions Architect for assistance.
