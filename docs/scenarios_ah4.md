#Test drive: Publish to MCS for Nutanix AHV
Once Unidesk is set up, you can use this test drive to create your first layers in Nutanix AHV, and then publish a test image to Citrix MCS. This example uses Windows 10 64-bit, Citrix MCS, and Citrix XenDesktop 7.
Please download the Test Drive from this Unidesk [forum article](http://www.unidesk.com/forum/unidesk-4/process-documentation-nutanix)[.](http://www.unidesk.com/forum/unidesk-4/process-documentation-nutanix)
If you have any questions, please ask your Unidesk Solutions Architect for assistance.
