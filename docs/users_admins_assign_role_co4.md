##About Unidesk users, roles, and rights
![](Resources/Images/user_builtin_admin_icon.png)###Built-in Administrator account
When you first install the Unidesk ELM (appliance) and log onto the Unidesk Management Console (UMC), there is a "built-in" Administrator account that you can use to get started. This Administrator has the rights to perform all Unidesk operations. You can edit this user's properties, including the name, password, and contact info. Be sure to change the password for this built-in Administrator account as part of installing and configuring the Unidesk ELM. 
![](Resources/Images/user_hybrid_icons.png)### AD###User accounts
Other than the built-in Administrator account, all Unidesk users are actually ADusers imported via one or more directory junctions. Once your directory junction(s) have been created, you can assign Unidesk Roles to each user, as described later in this topic. You can see which roles are assigned to a user in the User Details.

###Unidesk Roles defined<a name="Unidesk"></a>
Unidesk Roles determine which Unidesk modules a user can manage. Users assigned one or more Unidesk Roles can log into the UMC, and these users are listed on the Administrators tab (select Users > Administrators). 
Note: When upgrading from Unidesk 4.0.6 or earlier, users assigned the Machine Administrator Role in earlier releases will now be assigned the Read Only Role. If the user needs more than read only access, reconfigure the user roles, as needed.
