An App Layer is a bootable software image (virtual disk) containing one or more applications that you can use in any number of Layered Images. When creating an Image Template to use for publishing a Layered Image, you can include an OS Layer,  a Platform Layer, and any combination of App Layers, as long as  the  OSLayer used to create all of them is the same.
To create an App Layer, you open the Create Layer wizard, deploy a Packaging Machine in your environment, then install the application on it. Once the application is installed, you finalize the Layer.
A Packaging Machine is a VM where you install the application(s) that will be included in the Layer. Unidesk creates the Packaging Machine using the location and credentials you supply by selecting the Platform Target (hypervisor) and Connector Configuration containing this information. If you don't yet have the Connector Configuration you need, you can add a new one, as described in the steps below.
##Before you start<a name="Before"></a>
###Requirements
To create an App Layer, you need:
<ul>            <li><a href="layer_os_create.htm">Create an OSLayer</a> (Contains the OS for this application.)</li>        </ul>
###Optional resources 
You may want to create resources to facilitate the application installation process. These resources are for temporary use during installation only, and will not be used to deliver the application.
<ul>            <li> <a href="#Prerequi">Prerequisite Layers</a> </li>            <li> <a href="#Platform">Platform Layer  for Packaging Layers (Required if creating App Layers on a different hypervisor than the one from which you imported your OSLayer)</a></li>            <li><a href="#Run"> Run Once Script</a>            </li>        </ul>
####Prerequisite Layers:<a name="Prerequi"></a>####What are they and do I need any?<a name="Prerequi"></a>
Prerequisite Layers provide a mechanism to include existing Application Layers on the Packaging Disk when creating or adding a version to an Application Layer.  Prerequisite Layers should only be used if they are required, since it is possible that the prerequisite applications will pull something into the Layer that is not required for the current application deployment, and which may cause conflict in the future.  Prerequisite Layers can be required for several reasons:
<ul>            <li>      If the software installed in one layer is required by the current layer's application just to be installed.  For example, if you are installing an application that requires Java and you have Java in a separate layer.</li>            <li>If the software to be installed adds settings of an existing application.  For example, when installing an Office add-in, Microsoft Office must first be installed.</li>            <li>      If two applications modify the same registry key and the second application must add to a key and not replace it.  For example, two application that both modify logon keys in Windows like a Citrix Agent and Imprivata.</li>        </ul>
Note: Some of these issues can also be handled by putting the two applications in the same layer rather than using prerequisite layers. 
####Platform Layer:<a name="Platform"></a>####What is it and do I<a name="Platform"></a>####need one?<a name="Platform"></a>
A Platform Layer is a Unidesk Layer that contains the tools and hardware settings needed to either install and package an application during Layer creation, or to publish a Layered Image for provisioning servers in a specific environment. You can create a different Platform Layer for each environment in which you are creating Layers, or publishing Layered Images. 
There are two types of Platform Layers you can create: Platform Layers to use for Packaging other Layers, and Platform Layers for Publishing Layered Images.
####Run Once Script<a name="Run"></a>
You can include a Run Once script in an App Layer. This allows you to run a script the first time any Layered Image that includes the App Layer boots. If the App Layer  is elastically layered, the Run Once script runs when the App Layer Disk is mounted. Run Once scripts are typically used for apps, such as MSOffice, that require license activation on the first boot. 
##Prepare a new App Layer<a name="Create2"></a>
<ol>            <li>                <p>Select <b>Layers >App Layers</b> and select <b>Create Layer</b> in the Action bar. This opens the Create Layer wizard.</p>            </li>            <li>                <p>On the Layer Details tab, enter a <b>Layer Name</b> and <b>Version</b>, both required values. Optionally, you can also enter other values. For details, see more about these values <span><a href="#Create">below</a></span>.</p>            </li>            <li>                <p>On the OSLayer tab, select the OSLayer you want to associate with this App Layer. </p>            </li>            <li>                <p>(Optional) On the <span>Prerequisite Layers</span> tab, if the application you are layering requires other App Layers to be present during installation, select the <b>Include Prerequisite Layers</b> check box, and pick the necessary App Layer(s).</p>                <p><b>Notes:</b> </p>                <ul>                    <li>Prerequisite layers are used while installing applications, and are <i>not included</i> in the App Layer.</li>                    <li>Prerequisite layers are <i>not</i> included by default when adding a new <i>Version</i> to this App Layer. So, when you add a new Version to this App Layer, you must choose the Prerequisite Layers again, if needed.  </li>                    <li>The App Layer you are creating and each of its Prerequisite Layers must be associated with the selected OSLayer.</li>                </ul>            </li>            <li>                <p>On the Connector tab, select <b>Network File Share</b>. </p>            </li>            <li>                <p>On the Platform Layer tab, you can select a Platform Layer for Packaging Layers, <i>if</i> you need one. </p>                <p><b>Note:</b> You <i>only</i> need a Platform Layer for Packaging this Layer if you imported your OS from a different environment than the one where you will install the software on this Layer. </p>            </li>            <li>                <p>On the Packaging Disk tab, enter a <b>file name</b> for the Packaging Disk, and select the disk format.

Next, you can deploy the Packaging Machine for your Layer. 
##Deploy a Packaging Machine <a name="Deploy"></a>
The Packaging Machine is a temporary VM where you install the app(s) you want to include in the Layer. 
###Create the Packaging Machine 
The Task Description (example shown in the last step above) contains the location in your hypervisor environment where the disks for this Layer have been created.
<ol>            <li>                <p>Log into your hypervisor. </p>            </li>            <li>                <p>Back in the Unidesk Management Console, use the instructions in the expanded Packaging Disk Task shown below to navigate to the location where the Boot Disk and Packaging Disk have been created. </p>                <p><a href="Resources/Images/layers_app_action_required_vs.png"><img></img></a>                </p>            </li>            <li>                <p>In your hypervisor, create a VM from the Boot disk and name it <i>Layer_Name</i>Boot.<i>xxx</i>.</p>            </li>            <li>                <p>Use the hypervisor to  attach the disk called <i>Layer_Name</i>Pkg.<i>xxx</i> to the VM you just created.</p>                <p><b>Important:</b> Both disks you exported <i>must</i> be attached to the IDE.</p>            </li>            <li>                <p>Power on the VM. This is your Packaging Machine where you will install the app(s) to include in this Layer.</p>            </li>        </ol>
##Install the Application(s) <a name="Install"></a>
Now you can install your application(s) on the Packaging Machine. Keep in mind that the state of the app before you finalize the layer is what users experience when they access it, so it's important to leave the app as you want users to see it when they log in. More guidance about this is included in the steps below.
To install the application(s):
<ol>            <li>                <p>Remote log in to the Packaging Machine in vSphere. Be sure to log in with the User account you used to create the OSin vSphere.</p>            </li>            <li>                <p>Install the applications, along with any drivers, boot-level applications, or files that the user will need with it.</p>                <p>If an application installation requires a system restart, restart it manually. The Packaging Machine does not restart automatically.</p>            </li>            <li>                <p>Make sure the Packaging Machine is in the state you want it to be for the user:</p>                <ul>                    <li>If the applications you install require any post-installation setup or application registration, complete those steps now.  </li>                    <li>Remove any settings, configurations, files, mapped drives, or applications that you do not want to include on the Packaging Machine.</li>                </ul>            </li>        </ol>
Next, you will shut down the Packaging Machine and verify that the Layer is ready to finalize.
##Verify the Layer and shut down the Packaging Machine<a name="Verify"></a>
Once the application is installed on the Packaging Machine, it is important to verify that the Layer is ready to be finalized. To be ready for finalization, any required post-installation processing needs to be completed. For example, a reboot may be required, or a Microsoft NGen process may need to complete.
To verify that any outstanding processes are complete, you can run the Shutdown For Finalize tool (icon below), which appears on the Packaging Machine's desktop.  
![](Resources/Images/shutdown_for_finalize.png)
To use the Shutdown For Finalize tool:
<ol>            <li>If you are not logged into the Packaging Machine, remote log in as the user who created the machine.</li>            <li>Double-click the <i>Shutdown For Finalize</i> icon. A command line window displays messages detailing the layer verification process. </li>            <li>If there is an outstanding operation that must be completed before the Layer can be finalized, you are prompted to complete the process. For example, if a Microsoft NGen operation needs to complete, you may be able to expedite the NGen operation, as detailed <a href="#Layer_Integrity_Check">below</a>.</li>            <li>Once any pending operations are complete, double-click the <i>Shutdown For Finalize</i> icon again. This shuts down the Packaging Machine. </li>        </ol>
The Layer is now ready to finalize.
###Layer integrity messages you may see during the finalization process<a name="Layer_Integrity_Check"></a>
Layer integrity messages let you know what queued tasks must be completed before a Layer is finalized.
The new Layer or Version can only be finalized when the following conditions have been addressed:<a name="Layer_Integrity_Messages"></a>
<ul>            <ul>                <li>A reboot is pending to update drivers on the boot disk - please check and reboot the Packaging Machine.</li>                <li>A post-installation reboot is pending - please check and reboot the Packaging Machine.</li>                <li>An MSI install operation is in progress - please check the Packaging Machine.</li>                <li>                    <p>A Microsoft NGen operation is in progress in the background. </p>                    <p><b>Note:</b> If a Microsoft NGen operation is in progress, you may be able to expedite it, as described in the next section.</p>                </li>            </ul>        </ul>
###Expediting a Microsoft NGen operation <a name="Complete_MS_NGen_Operations"></a>
NGen is the Microsoft Native Image Generator.  It is part of the .NET system, and basically re-compiles .NET byte code into native images and constructs the registry entries to manage them.  Windows will decide when to run NGen, based on what is being installed and what Windows detects in the configuration.  When NGen is running, you must let it complete.  An interrupted NGen operation can leave you with non-functioning .NET assemblies or other problems in the .NET system.
You have the choice of waiting for the NGen to complete in the background, or you can force the NGen to the foreground. You can also check the status of the NGen operation, as described below. However, every time you check the queue status, you are creating foreground activity, which might cause the background processing to temporarily pause. 
Forcing the NGen to the foreground will allow you to view the progress and once the output has completed, you should be able to finalize the layer.
<ol>            <li>                <p>Force an NGen operation to the foreground. </p>                <p>Normally, NGen is a background operation and will pause if there is foreground activity.  Bringing the task into the foreground can help the task to complete as quickly as possible. To do this:</p>                <ol>                    <li>                        <p>Open a command prompt as Administrator.</p>                    </li>                    <li>                        <p>Go to the Microsoft .NET Framework directory for the version currently in use:</p><pre>cd C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\FrameworkNN\vX.X.XXXXX</pre>                    </li>                    <li>                        <p>Enter the NGen command to execute the queued items:</p><pre>ngen update /force</pre>                        <p>This brings the NGen task to the foreground in the command prompt, and lists the assemblies being compiled. </p>                        <p><b>Note:</b> It’s okay if you see several compilation failed messages!</p>                    </li>                    <li>Look in the Task Manager to see if an instance of MSCORSVW.EXE is running. If it is, you must allow it to complete, or re-run <span>ngen update /force</span>.  Do <i>not</i> reboot to stop the task. You <i>must</i> allow it to complete.</li>                </ol>            </li>            <li>                <p>Check the status of an NGen operation</p>                <ol>                    <li>                        <p>Open a command prompt as Administrator.</p>                    </li>                    <li>                        <p>Check status by running this command:</p><pre>ngen queue status</pre>                    </li>                    <li>                        <p>When you receive the following status, the NGen is complete, and you can finalize the Layer.</p><pre>The .NET Runtime Optimization Service is stopped</pre>                    </li>                </ol>            </li>        </ol>
##Finalize the Layer<a name="Finalize"></a>
Once the software has been installed and the Packaging Machine has been verified and shut down, you are ready to finalize the layer.  
Note: When you finalize a Layer, Unidesk may delete the Packaging Machine to minimize storage space used. 
When the Layer has been verified and is ready to finalize:
<ol>            <li>Return to the Unidesk Management Console.</li>            <li>Select <b>Layers >App Layers</b>, and then the layer you just prepared.</li>            <li>Select <span>Finalize</span> in the Action bar. The Finalize wizard appears.</li>            <li>(Optional) On the Script Path wizard tab, you can enter the path to a Run Once Script located on a server on your network. <ul><li>If the App Layer is elastically assigned, the Run Once script will be executed the first time the app is used. </li><li>If the App Layer is included in a Layered Image, the Run Once script will be executed the first time the Layered Image is booted. </li></ul></li>            <li>Click <b>Finalize</b> to finish creating the Layer.</li>            <li>Monitor the Task bar to verify that the action completes successfully and that the Layer is ready to be deployed.</li>        </ol>
##Reference: Create App Layer Wizard values<a name="Create"></a>
<ul>            <li><i>Layer Name</i> - (Required) A name that will let you know what app(s) the layer will be used for. </li>            <li><i>Layer Description</i> - (Optional) Description of the Layer </li>            <li>                <p><i>Version</i> - (Required) This can be the version of the application or a version you assign to the Layer. This value is displayed in the Details view of the Layer. Keep in mind that you'll add a new version to this layer whenever you update the app(s) included in it, and this is where the version will be described.</p>            </li>            <li><i>Version Description</i> - (Optional) Enter a description of the version.</li>            <li><i>Specify the Max Layer Size</i> - Maximum layer size in gigabytes.
