#Test drive: Publish to Citrix XenServer
Once Unidesk is set up, you can use this test drive to create your first layers in XenServer, and then publish a test image to Citrix PVS. This example uses Windows Server 2012, Citrix PVS 7, and Citrix XenApp 7.
Please download the Test Drive from this Unidesk [forum article](http://www.unidesk.com/forum/unidesk-4/process-documentation-publish-citrix-xenserver)[.](http://www.unidesk.com/forum/unidesk-4/process-documentation-publish-citrix-xenserver)
