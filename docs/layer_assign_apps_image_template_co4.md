An Image Template is a stored selection of Layers and settings that you use to publish Layered Images. At minimum, an Image Template contains an OS Layer, Platform Layer, and settings. Ideally, each template also contains your choice of App Layers for a particular image, for example, an image suited for the users served by a particular silo. Once you publish a Layered Image, you can provision systems using the  image.

When you create a new App Layer, you can assign the App Layer to one or more Unidesk Image Templates, and then use the templates to publish Layered Images that include the layer. This article explains how to  assign an App Layer to one or more Image Templates, and update the assignments when you update the Layer. 
When you first update an App Layer, the new Layer Version is not assigned to any Image Templates, so you'll need to update the Layer Assignments. Updating the assignments allows you to assign different Versions of the Layer to different Image Templates. You cannot assign an App Layer to 
Important: When assigning App Layers, be sure to avoid assigning the app elastically to a user, if the app is already in the Layered Image that the user gets.
