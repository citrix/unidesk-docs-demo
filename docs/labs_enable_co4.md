##Welcome to Unidesk Labs<a name="Welcome"></a>
Want to experiment with cool new features that are under development? Through the Unidesk Management Console, you can now see which features are available in Unidesk Labs in any given release. You can enable features you're interested in, try them out, and let us know what you think. The only caveat? Best not use Labs features in your production environment, as they are likely to evolve with the feedback we receive from users like you! 
In the Learning Center, features that are available through Unidesk Labs are marked (Unidesk Labs) in the title. Some Unidesk Labs features require enabling, as described in the next section, though in the current release, the features available through Labs do not need to be enabled.
