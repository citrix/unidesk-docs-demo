#Publish Layered Images
Once you have an OSLayer and a Platform Layer, a best practice is to verify that the Layers can be published to your environment as part of a Layered Image. Then you can build out the image by adding App Layers to it.
To publish the Layered Image, you first add the Layers to an Image Template, and use the template to publish a Layered Image. Once you have verified that the Layered Image is successfully published, create your App Layers, add them  to your Image Template, and publish a Layered Image.
